Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between housing affordability and crime rates across U.S. states, leveraging publicly available datasets on housing prices, crime statistics, and demographic information. The analysis focuses on understanding how factors like housing supply, ownership patterns, and crime rates correlate with each other.

Key Features:
Data Integration: Merged datasets from multiple sources, including housing prices (ZHVI) and crime statistics, with census-based demographic data.
Statistical Analysis: Performed correlation analysis to explore relationships between housing affordability and crime rates by state.
Geospatial Visualization: Created choropleth maps to visually represent the distribution of housing affordability and crime rates across the country.
Challenges: Addressed issues with missing data, inconsistent formats, and ensuring meaningful statistical comparisons across states with varying conditions.

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Plotly, Folium)
Data Visualization (Choropleth maps, Heatmaps)
Statistical Analysis (Correlation, Descriptive Statistics)
Tableau
